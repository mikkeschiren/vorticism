# Vorticism

A short introduction to Vorticism

- Maybe not the most political correct art movement to talk about, and that makes it even more interesting.

Note: I cling to the spar,

Washed with the cold salt ice

I cling to the spar–

Insidious modern waves, civilization, civilized hidden snares.

Cowardly editors threaten: ‘‘If I dare”

Say this or that, or speak my open mind,

Say that I hate may hates,

Say that I love my friends,

Say I believe in Lewis, spit out the later Rodin,

Say that Epstein can carve in stone,

That Brzeska can use the chisel,

Or Wadsworth paint;

Then they will have my guts;

They will cut down my wage, force me to sing their cant,

Uphold the press, and be before all a model of literary decorum.

Merde!

Cowardly editors threaten,

Friends fall off at the pinch, the loveliest die.

That is the path of life, this is my forest.

Note: The lateral vibrations caress me,
They leap and caress me,
They work pathetically in my favour,
They seek my financial good.

She of the spear stands present.
The gods of the underworld attend me, O Annubis,
These are they of thy company.
With a pathetic solicitude they attend me;
Undulant,
Their realm is the lateral courses.

Light!
I am up to follow thee, Pallas.
Up and out of their caresses.
You were gone up as a rocket,
Bending your passages from right to left and from left to right
In the flat projection of a spiral.
The gods of drugged sleep attend me,
Wishing me well;
I am up to follow thee, Pallas.s
